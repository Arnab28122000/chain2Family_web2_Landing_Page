            <FAQTile question='How to tokenize real estate?' answer="Tokenization is the process in which  real estate assets are converted into several virtual (digital) tokens. Further selling these virtual tokens on an online marketplace. The purchaser of a particular token owns that portion of the asset. In real estate tokenization, every token represents direct ownership of an asset. These assets can be a share in a company owning real estate, a piece of real estate or else participation in a real estate investment fund or anything else. Hence, with the help of tokenization, property purchasers can do transactions digitally using tokens instead of the traditional way of paper documentation. "/>
            <FAQTile question='Why should I tokenize real estate?' answer="The motive behind tokenization is to secure real assets; thatâ€™s why it is also called security tokens. Like securitizing an asset means dividing it into shares; the same way tokenization means splitting an asset into tokens (shares), representing a particular share of the underlying asset. "/>
