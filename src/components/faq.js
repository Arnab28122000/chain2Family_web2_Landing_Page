            answer:"The C2F network provides a native desktop and mobile application that communicates back to the public layer of the network. The user then selects what type of physical and digital assets they would like to tokenize. After successful verification of ownership through our intergration with chainlinks DON (decentraliced oracle network), the user will receive an overview of their tokenized assets value. They will then be presented a final confirmation of asset transfer where they will SWAP their native C2FCoins to receive their tokenized assets in the form of C2FTokens, further uploading to their blockchain.",

            question:'Why should I tokenize with the C2F Network?ðŸ¤”', 
            answer:"Why wouldn't you? We're pioneering the FUTURE of asset management! Our network allows the capability for the user to BRANCH out into their own blockchain ledgers where they'll have an extra layer of economic freedom and security that the current financial system fails to provide. Additionally our community members will have access to a complete DeFi Marketplace called the BranchMarket. This BranchMarket hosts addtional BranchApplications (dApps) providing a wide range of services and features",
